We have created a project annual sales report for 2023 to understand customer's needs, spending habits, purhcasing power and imporve sales.


Conclusion - 
Women are statistically more inclined to make purchases than men, with a participation rate of approximately 65%. 
The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh account for about 35% of these purchases.
The adult age group of 30 to 49 years contributes significantly, representing around 50% of the total sales. 
Additionally, the leading online channels driving these sales are Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, which together contribute roughly 80%.

To enhance sales at United Store, it is recommended to focus on targeting female customers aged 30 to 49 who reside in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. This can be achieved by promoting advertisements, offers, and coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
